      <div class="description">
        The <span class="highlight">Mountain Railways of India</span> are a group of narrow-gauge railways that traverse the most rugged and scenic terrains in the Indian subcontinent. These railways were built during the British colonial era and demonstrate exceptional engineering skill and adaptation to high-altitude environments.
        <br /><br />
        Currently, three railways are inscribed as <span class="highlight">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</span>: the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the Kalka‚ÄìShimla Railway. Each of these lines offers a unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty.
        <br /><br />
        These railways continue to operate and are a major attraction for tourists, train lovers, and heritage explorers from across the world. Their legacy is a remarkable fusion of British ingenuity and Indian topographical mastery.

        <p>
          Also known as the "Toy Train," this 88 km railway route connects New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling, reaching altitudes over 2,200 meters. Constructed between 1879 and 1881, it features innovative loops and zig-zags to handle the steep terrain.
          <br /><br />
          It was the first of the mountain railways to be recognized by UNESCO in 1999. The railway winds through lush tea gardens, colonial-era stations, and cloud-kissed mountains.

        <p>
          The Nilgiri Mountain Railway runs between Mettupalayam and Udhagamandalam (Ooty) in Tamil Nadu. It is the only rack-and-pinion railway in India, allowing the train to climb steep gradients with ease.
          <br /><br />
          Built in 1908, the NMR offers breathtaking views of the Nilgiri Hills, tea plantations, and forested valleys. It was added to the World Heritage list in 2005 as an extension of the Darjeeling line.

        <p>
          Stretching 96 km through the Shivalik hills, the Kalka‚ÄìShimla Railway was opened in 1903 to connect the summer capital of British India‚ÄîShimla‚Äîwith the plains of Punjab. It features more than 100 tunnels and over 800 bridges.
          <br /><br />
          The line is an engineering marvel that snakes through pine forests and hilly terrains. Its aesthetic value and historical significance led to its inclusion in the UNESCO list in 2008.
